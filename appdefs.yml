      FreeFileSync is a folder comparison and synchronization software that
      creates and manages backup copies of all your important files. Instead
      of copying every file every time, FreeFileSync determines the differences
      between a source and a target folder and transfers only the minimum amount
      of data needed.

      - title: Scheduled Batch Jobs
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container provides an easy way to run FreeFileSync batch jobs according to
          a specified schedule.  One or more jobs can be configured via the following
          environment variables:

          - `FFS_SCHEDULED_BATCH_JOB_<ID>_NAME`: Name of the job.  Must match the file
            name of the saved FreeFileSync synchronization configuration.
          - `FFS_SCHEDULED_BATCH_JOB_<ID>_CRON`: Cron expression of the schedule.  See
            https://crontab.guru to create a valid Cron expression.

          Where `<ID>` is a numerical identifier of your choice.

          First, the synchronization configuration must be setup in FreeFileSync.  Once
          done, it has to be saved as a "batch Job", under `/config` inside the container.
          The name of the file, without the `.ffs_batch` extension, must match the name of
          the job set via the environment variable.

          For example, if `FFS_SCHEDULED_BATCH_JOB_1_NAME` is set to `MyBackup1`, the
          FreeFileSync synchronization configuration should be saved to
          `/config/MyBackup1.ffs_batch`.

          **NOTE**: When saving a batch job, it is advised to enable the `Auto-close`
          option.  Else, the job won't run again unless its window is manually closed.

          **NOTE**: Make sure to first run the batch job from the UI to make sure there is
          no issue with the job itself.
